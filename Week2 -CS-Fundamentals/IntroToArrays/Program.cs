Problem: There is a lot of DATA that exists!!!
Managing each piece in its own variable is going to become impractical
A lot is quite similar or related whethers its by purpose or even Data Type.

We need introduce means to store multiple pieces of data within one device/variable.

Arrays -> offers a way for us to very simply store multiple values of the same Data Type.

DataType[] variableName = new DataType[size];
*/

//Basic Example
int[] numbers = new int[5];
