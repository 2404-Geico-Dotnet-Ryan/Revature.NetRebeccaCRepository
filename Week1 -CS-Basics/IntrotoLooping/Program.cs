/*
Control Flow - Loops allow us to execute a chunk of code for as long as the condition continues to be true. 
    - The condition is reassessed after each "iteration' of the loop, before executing the loop again.
    - Major Types 
        - While Loop 
            -Do while loop
            -Best used when the number of iterations (outcomes) needed by the loop is not known/non-deterministic
                - example validation (how many times does it take to successfully sign in)
                - but there can be limits set or left for them to continue to try forever
        - For loop 
            - For each loop
            - best used the number of iterations by the loop is known or could be calculated (calculatable)
            - Finite
