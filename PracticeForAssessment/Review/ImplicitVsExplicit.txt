- Implicit Conversion
		- implied
		- Done for us
		- Changing from one state to another
		automatically or at least without us having
		to say so.


	- Explicit Conversion
		- explained/exact/defined
		- We state that we want to happen
		- Changing from one state to another
		wherein we specifically tell it to do so.


	- C#


	int num1 = 15;
	double num2 = num1;

	Converting from int to double is done implicitly

	double num1 = 15.5;
	int num2 = (int) num1;

	Converting from double too int (in this case) is done explicitly.

	
	- C# is a Strong Typed Language
		- There is no implicit conversion of Types. :O


	Console.WriteLine("My number is: " + 5);
	Python: print("My number is: " + str(5))

	string input = "123";
	int result = int.Parse(int.ToString(123)); //silly code dont try at home.
