/*
Guessing Game - make a new project 
    - Start with teh asumed range of numbers 1-100
    - Prompt the user to Enter number in set range
    - Tell the user if the number is higher or lower or equal to number you program
    - If they are = they win the guessing game
    - IF higher or lower let them guess again
    - The while loop essentially need to contain 
        - Prompt the user
        -retrieve their quess 
        -tell them higher or lower or if correct
        - while (gues !=correctChoice) -> run the loop again
    Bonus
    - create your own library/Random Class (Random number genearator) that way you can play too
    - The user is prompted to play again with out having to re run the program 
        - involves (likely) another (outer) while loop

        for self study for loops?
